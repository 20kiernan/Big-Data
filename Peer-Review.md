Peer Review

In order for each group member to have an evenly distributed work, we would discuss the work which lead towards dividing the work. Later on collaborating to each other information that one has been informed or done within their individual work time. In other words, we would catch up gaining more knowledge over the content we chose not having to be further behind. We choose this method because it was an easier way to finish any assignment assigned according to the requirements. Unfortunately, the methods we accominated didnâ€™t quite successfully worked out as planned it turned out that one group member ended up doing all the work in. How I coordinate my effort was accurate was an task and dedicated to the work. A collaboration that went well was our final product in our project which was the website. The partners / group members that I had been assigned to tried there very best to understand the concept which I honestly appreciate for their hard dedication and commitment throughout the whole project.
